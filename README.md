# Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing

This project enables decentralized image upload and sharing using blockchain technology. It leverages Solidity for the smart contract development and React for the front-end interface. 

The key features of the project include:

- **Secure Image Upload**: Users can securely upload images to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
- **Smart Contract Integration**: A smart contract written in Solidity manages image sharing and access control.
- **User Access Control**: Users can share access to their uploaded images with specified individuals through smart contract functionality.

By combining the decentralized storage capabilities of IPFS with the security and transparency of blockchain technology, this project ensures a robust and private image sharing platform.


## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Smart contract development for ownership and access control.
- **React:** Front-end interface for uploading images and managing access.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded images.
-**Hardhat**  Hardhat for development and testing.
